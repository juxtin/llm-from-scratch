The reference output is \"He remained optimistic despite the challenges he faced.\" The model\\'s output is \"In this sentence, the person\\'s mind is filled with a sense of excitement, uncertainty, and uncertainty.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to check if the model used the word \\'optimistic\\'. The reference output clearly includes it. The model\\'s output doesn\\'t have the word \\'optimistic\\' at all. Instead, it talks about excitement, uncertainty, and uncertainty. So the model didn\\'t use the required word. \\n\\nNext, the model\\'s sentence is grammatically correct, but it doesn\\'t meet the instruction. The instruction was to use the word \\'optimistic\\', which the model didn\\'t. The model\\'s response is about the person\\'s mind being filled with certain emotions, but that\\'s not using the word. \\n\\nThe reference output is a correct sentence that includes the word. The model\\'s output is a sentence that doesn\\'t include the word. So the model failed to follow the instruction. \\n\\nSince the model didn\\'t use the word \\'optimistic\\', the response is factually incorrect in the context of the task. Therefore, the score should be below 50. However, the model\\'s sentence is grammatically correct and relevant to the topic, but it\\'s not meeting the specific instruction. \\n\\nThe example given in the problem shows that if the answer is incorrect but grammatically correct, it\\'s scored lower. Here, the model\\'s response is not using the required word, so it\\'s factually incorrect. Hence, the score should be low, maybe around 25, as in the example. But I need to check if there\\'s any other aspect. \\n\\nThe model\\'s response is a complete sentence, but it\\'s not using the required word. So the answer is not correct. Therefore, the score is below 50. The example had 25 because the answer was incorrect but grammatically correct. Here, the answer is incorrect and doesn\\'t use the required word. So maybe 25 is appropriate.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe model\\'s response does not include the word \"optimistic\" as required by the instruction, making it factually incorrect in the context of the task. While the sentence is grammatically correct, it fails to meet the specific requirement of using the target word.  \\n25',\n",
