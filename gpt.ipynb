    "## 5. MultiHeadAttention\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the heart of what makes GPT different to earlier language models. The attention mechanism tweaks context vectors in response to earlier tokens in the sequence, shifting their \"meaning\" to become much richer and more specific than a single word could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivating Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take the sentence \"the cat sat on the mat because it was warm.\" The word \"it\" has one particular vector embedding in the vocabulary, which might relate loosely to concepts like \"noun\" and \"non-human.\" That's not enough to capture the meaning of \"it\" in this sentence, where it most likely refers to \"mat.\" Attention allows the system to change the vector for the \"it\" token to resemble the vector for \"mat,\" clarifying its meaning in the context of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's about the simplest possible example, but in reality each token is pushed and pulled in much more subtle ways by many more tokens in the sequence, so that by the end it somehow represents the meaning of the entire sequence of text. Ultimately, the attention-modulated vector of the final token in the sequence is _the only input needed_ to predict the next token. That's pretty wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more contrived example of what this means, take another example sequence: \"This gritty, romantic, windswept, ornate, melancholic city is none other than\". The word \"than\" has nothing to do with any particular city or place, but by the time its vector is modulated by this long series of words preceding it, it will be something that appears close (in embedding space) to cities like Lisbon and Istanbul. Indeed, those are the two most likely predictions for the final word in the sequence from GPT-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-head attention was first described in \"Attention is All You Need\" (2017), in sections 3.2.1 (scaled dot-product attention) and 3.2.2 (extending to multiple heads). I'll be using that paper as a reference for the following two sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Each attention head is an instance of something called \"scaled dot-product attention,\" which is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the attention weights given matrices K, Q, and V are the result of applying softmax to the product of Q times K-transpose over the square root of the embedding size of K, all multiplied by V.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll try to break that down a bit more:\n",
    "- Q, K, and V are trainable matrix parameters with the same dimensions as the token embedding vectors. They are short for Query, Key, and Value.\n",
    "  - I think of the Query parameter as representing what a token is \"looking for\" to know if another token is worth attending to.\n",
    "  - To continue that metaphor, the Key parameter is what other tokens \"look like\" to the Query.\n",
    "  - The Value is the real identity of the tokens that are found, their deeper reality beneath the appearance presented by the Key.\n",
    "  - To sum up, a token's Query is used to examine every other token's Key to see if it's a good match. If it is, we use that token's Value in attention weight.\n",
    "- Multiplying Q by the transpose of K gives us the dot product of every Query row against every Key row. In other words, it tells us how aligned every Query is with every Key.\n",
    "- We scale that by the inverse square root of the Key dimensions to counteract a known issue with dot-product attention: \"for large values of d_k, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients.\" (\"Attention is All You Need,\" p. 4). In other words, the dot product of two rows is going to tend to get larger the more columns you have, and these large values make it hard for training to adjust weights effectively. Scaling by the square root of the number of columns helps to solve this.\n",
    "- Applying softmax turns these scaled dot products into weights.\n",
    "- Multiplying by V translates the weights by Key into weights by Value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: it's not described in detail in the paper, but there's an important step carried out here called masking. Essentially, we only want Queries to find Keys that _precede_ them in the sequence. We accomplish this by zeroing out values above the main diagonal. To make sure that these values are zero _after_ softmax, we first set them to minus-infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "In single-headed dot-product attention, Q, K, and V all have the same dimensions as the input and output embeddings. To use multiple heads, we divide the width of each parameter by the number of heads and concatenate them together. This results in the same overall dimensions, but with different sets of columns relating to different Value vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O$\n",
