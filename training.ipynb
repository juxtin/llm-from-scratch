    "## A more mature training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete training function has to represent a set of somewhat orthogonal concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training itself: calculating training loss and backpropagating.\n",
    "2. Setting the learning rate based on the current step, etc.\n",
    "3. Evaluating the current validation loss for the model.\n",
    "4. Reporting metrics (e.g., to MLflow or stdout), which may include generating an example completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train_simple_text` function attempts to focus as much as possible on 1, barely touching the other points.\n",
    "Now that we're moving on, that's going to have to change. The problem is that we need some amount of extensibility\n",
    "and I don't think a gigantic configuration dict and a mess of conditionals is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question is this: how do we build an extensible and maintainable training loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The core training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, I don't see much reason to do this differently than `train_simple_text`. I think any significant differences\n",
    "will come from implementing the other requirements below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Setting the learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an area where I do need to build on what I did before, and it definitely needs to be configurable. However,\n",
    "I don't think I need to modularize this part. I'm pretty sure that a learning rate warmup with cosine decay will be\n",
    "good enough for all my planned use cases, so I'll implement that as a one-size-fits-all solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do wonder how this will fit in, though. Will it all be part of the same function? Controlled by a separate helper\n",
    "function? Encapsulated in a class? Unclear at this point, but hopefully not that last option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Evaluating the current validation loss for the model\n",
    "\n",
    "I think there are two real options here:\n",
    "- **a**. use some kind of modular/callback system to invert control around model evaluation (think event loop)\n",
    "- **b**. rely on a `validation_loader` parameter and configuration options\n",
    "\n",
    "Option **a** is probably needlessly complicated on its own, but there's an argument that we get it for \"free\" if we\n",
    "implement some kind of event-driven metrics system. I'll say more about that below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If option **b** is adequate, it's hard to argue that it's not the right way forward. I might need to review the classification\n",
    "code, but IIRC there's really no need to do anything differently for validation there; we're still just comparing the model's\n",
    "output to the target from the validation loader. If I'm wrong about that, then that weighs heavily in favor of a more modular\n",
    "system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Reporting metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where I really think a modular approach is appropriate. I like using MLflow, but it's not appropriate for every single\n",

    "different options.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned in sub-section 3, this does open up the possibility that the metrics handler could _also_ decide when and how\n",
    "to do a validation run, which would simplify the code in the training function and provide more flexibility. However, there's\n",
    "a good chance that every metrics handler implementation would end up doing basically the same thing for validation and then\n",
    "it's not a win at all."
